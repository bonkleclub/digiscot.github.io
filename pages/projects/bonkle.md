## Project plan

### Project description

Introduction to the various types of computers available with the accent on tablets and notebooks to allow the participants to make an informed choice matched to their requirements. Instruction in the use of these computers and the software available.

Initially present members, who are mainly elderly, and either do not have a computer or have an outdated one will be given the chance to try out the various types to guide them in their choice of computer type. This will be followed by instruction in the use of the chosen type. At the end of this period, assessment will be carried out and, on the basis of this, any required changes will be made before recruitment of new members.
W already have notebook computers running Windows10 Preview.The grant has allowed the purchase of sufficient Ipads and Android tablet computers allowing us to start demonstration/tuition on these. This will be carried out during June with existing members. A survey will then be taken before further recruitment. The holiday period will, however, delay this.
This has now been carried out


## Project milestones
Aim - to help participants to make an informed choice on type of computer and operaing system


## Evaluation

After demonstration and "hands on" experience with the various computers and operating systems a "tick box" survey was carried out which is listed below.
Choice of computers and operating systems survey.
Summary of results

Was sufficient guidance given to choose a suitable type of computer?      		9.6/10

Was sufficient guidance given to choose a suitable type of operating system?	9.8/10

What type of computer would you prefer? 	Desktop 16%		Notebook 50%	Tablet 33%

If you could afford a second computer what would your choice be? 

						Desktop 0%		Notebook 33%	Tablet 67%

What type of operating system would you prefer?

PC						Windows 7 30%	Windows 10 70%
Tablet						Android 57%		Apple IOS    43%

Do you wish further tuition on your chosen computer type/operating system?    Yes -  100%

Most important factors in choosing a computer (13 topics given, top 5)

1) Reliability  2) Manufacturer  3) Quality of screen  4) Operating system  5) Cost

Comments on course.
“Covered aspects relevant to group needs”
“Good introduction to the technology”
“Very important to me ….gain confidence from my attendance ..makes one aware of “the world” of computing”
“Socialising with fellow members”
Course was excellent, educational and informative. My computer and IT skill have improved immensely”
“First class tuition. Very educational and interesting. Keeps mind alert due to tuition”
“Learned a great deal and hope to continue”
“Course very good and informative”
“Opened up my mind to wonderful new ways of operating computers”

### Outputs and outcomes

The results of the survey would indicate that the tuition and training seemed to be sufficient to allow participants to make an informed choice as to type of computer and operating system that would be most suitable for their use.


In terms of outputs we delivered A, B and C.

In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has P, Q and R. We know this because J, K and L.

### Lessons learned
As an introduction, this course seemed to be satisfactory but it is obvious that if people wish to be come proficient in the use of their chosen system further instruction will be required and all asked for this.

Things that worked well:
Demonstrations of the types of computer systems via a large screen worked well.
All enjoyed the "hands on" use of the various computers.
Further courses along similar lines will be run after the summer break and then over future years as demand requires especially when new devices/operating systems are introduced.
Further reports will be submitted when other courses have been run

Things that we would do differently next time:

1. Revise the survey sheet
2. Text
3. Text
